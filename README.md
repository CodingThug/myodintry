# myodintry

I'm 42, and I'm learning how to code. Let's see how this goes. Odin Project is one of my free resources.

I've made quite a few mistakes in my life. I followed so many people, and found out late in life how serious having formal education, and a plan to succeed, is.
I feel I am a bit fortunate to have been able to at least find this avenue to create a stream of revenue for myself.
It's not that I need the money, which I do, but my children would really benefit from having more funds at their disposal.
I will continue to try my best to right my wrongs, and not allow my past to dictate my future.
